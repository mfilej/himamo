  ## Discrete Hidden Markov Models for Elixir

  This library presents a rough attempt at training and simulation of hidden
  markov models. It supports discrete models and multiple observation
  sequences.

  See following modules for usage examples:

    * Training a model: [Himamo.Training]
    * Simulating a model: [Himamo.Sim]
